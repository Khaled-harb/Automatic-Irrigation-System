# Automatic-Irrigation-System
In this project i built a seeds data in ( DBConfiguration ) Class.
Please setup the date of the timeToBeIrrigate which is a hashset List in the same class to fit your test case.
The system shuold be able to irrigate the plots automaticly in time and let you know in the logger .
If there a sensor issue (which i did in the third polt for test case ) then Alert system be active agin you will know in the logger .
